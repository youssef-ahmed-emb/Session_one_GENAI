      "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many Ballon d'Or awards Lionel Messi has won. I know the Ballon d'Or is a prestigious award given to the best soccer player in the world each year. I remember hearing that Messi has won it several times, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me start by recalling what I know about Messi's career. He's an Argentine player who's been with Barcelona for most of his career and recently moved to Paris Saint-Germain. He's known for his incredible skill on the field, his goal-scoring ability, and his numerous records. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think the Ballon d'Or is awarded annually by France Football, a French sports magazine. It's based on a vote by international sports journalists. The award started in 1956, so it's been around for a while. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I remember that both Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have been dominating the award for many years. There was a period where they alternated wins, each pushing the other to perform better. I think Messi has more Ballon d'Or awards than Ronaldo, but I'm not certain. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me try to list the years I think Messi won. I believe he won his first Ballon d'Or in 2009. That was a year after he helped Barcelona win the Champions League. Then, I think he won it again in 2010, 2011, and 2012. That would make four in a row. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but I also remember that in 2013 and 2014, Cristiano Ronaldo won the award. So Messi didn't win those years. Then in 2015, I think Messi won it again because Barcelona had a great season, winning the treble. That would be his fifth Ballon d'Or. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2016, I believe Ronaldo won it again after leading Portugal to the Euro championship. Then in 2017, Ronaldo won it for a fifth time, tying him with Messi at five each. \n",
      "\n",
      "But then in 2019, I think Messi won his sixth Ballon d'Or. That was after an incredible season where he scored a lot of goals and led Barcelona to another La Liga title. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2020, the Ballon d'Or was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so no one won it that year. Then in 2021, Messi won it again after leading Argentina to the Copa America victory and having a great season with Paris Saint-Germain. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the 2021 award. I thought maybe someone else won it, but I think it was Messi because of the Copa America win. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, adding that up: 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019, and 2021. That would make seven Ballon d'Or awards for Messi. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, did I count that right? Let me check the years again. 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012—that's four. Then 2015 is the fifth, 2019 the sixth, and 2021 the seventh. Yeah, that seems correct. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think I might have heard somewhere that Messi has seven Ballon d'Ors, which is a record. Cristiano Ronaldo has five, I believe. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it all together, Messi has won the Ballon d'Or seven times: 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019, and 2021. That makes him the player with the most Ballon d'Or awards in history.\n",

Then in 2020, the award was canceled because of the pandemic. So, he didn't win that year. Then in 2021, I believe he won it again, which would make it seven times. \n",
